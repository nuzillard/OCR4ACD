Normally we run Tesseract on Debian GNU Linux, but there was also the need for a Windows version. That's why we have built a
Tesseract installer for Windows.

WARNING: Tesseract should be either installed in the directory which is suggested during the installation or in a new
directory. The uninstaller removes the whole installation directory. If you installed Tesseract in an existing directory, that
directory will be removed with all its subdirectories and files.
